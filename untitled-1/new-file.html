<h1> Jurzee Turk</h1> 
<h2> My work</h2> 
<p> I work at Buffalo Wild Wings. I am a server there and have been for almost a year. I also work at a food truck my family owns. It's called turks. We have owned it for almost 3 years.</p> 
<h2> My Pets</h2> 
<p> My family owns a lot of animals. We have 7 cats, one of them is hairless. We have two dogs and 2 guinea pigs. 
<h2> Hobbies</h2> 
<p> I love to bake even though I'm not very good at it. I also love to go swimming. I don't normally have time to do my hobbies because I'm always busy with work and school.
